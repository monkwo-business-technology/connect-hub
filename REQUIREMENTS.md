Product Structure for Your Vision

the app should be built around 3 CORE PILLARS:

A. Communities (Spaces)

Different spaces people can enter based on interest.

Examples:
	•	💕 Dating & Relationships
	•	💼 Business & Networking
	•	🎓 Education & Learning
	•	⚽ Sports & Football
	•	🌍 Travel & Culture
	•	🎮 Gaming
	•	🗣 General Chat / Open Lounge

Each community contains:
	•	Live rooms
	•	Chat rooms
	•	Events
	•	Profiles related to that interest

⸻

B. Live Interaction (Your Monetization Engine)

Inside each community:
	•	Live video rooms
	•	Audio rooms
	•	Live panel discussions
	•	Live dating sessions
	•	Live business pitch sessions
	•	Live classes / teachings

This is where:
	•	Gifting happens
	•	Subscriptions make sense
	•	Visibility boosts happen

⸻

C. Connection Layer

From any community, people can:
	•	DM after verification 
	•	Match (dating)
	•	Connect (business)
	•	Follow

This is what turns interaction into relationships.

⸻

3. What Your App Navigation Should Look Like

Instead of only:

Discovery → Chat → Gift

You should structure it like:

Bottom Navigation (Example)
	1.	Home
	2.	Communities
	3.	Live
	4.	Messages
	5.	Profile

Let me break each one down.

4. Proper Hi-Fi Structure (What You Should Actually Design)

1. Onboarding (Very Important)

User selects:
	•	Why are you here?
	•	Dating
	•	Business
	•	Learning
	•	Networking
	•	Just social
	•	Interests:
	•	Football
	•	Tech
	•	Fashion
	•	Real estate
	•	Relationships
	•	etc.

This determines:
	•	Which communities they see
	•	Which lives are recommended

⸻

2. Home Screen (Personalized Feed)

Contains:
	•	🔴 Live now in your communities
	•	Suggested people
	•	Upcoming events
	•	Trending rooms

This is NOT only dating profiles.
It’s activity-based discovery.

⸻

3. Communities Screen (Core of Your Vision)

Grid or list of:
	•	Dating Lounge 💕
	•	Business Hub 💼
	•	Education Corner 🎓
	•	Sports Arena ⚽
	•	Open Mic 🗣
	•	City Groups (Lagos, Abuja, etc.)

Clicking one opens:
	•	Live rooms
	•	Active chats
	•	Top members
	•	Upcoming sessions

This is where your “circle / clique / tribe” idea lives.

⸻

4. Community Detail Screen

For example: Business Hub

Tabs:
	•	Live
	•	Chat Rooms
	•	Members
	•	Events

Inside:
	•	“Pitch your business” live room
	•	“Looking for partner” chat
	•	“Investment talks” live session

Same structure for:
	•	Dating
	•	Education
	•	Football
	•	etc.

⸻

5. Live Room Screen (Your Money Maker 💰)

Contains:
	•	Host video
	•	Participants
	•	Chat
	•	Gift button
	•	Follow button
	•	Invite button

Gifting, subscriptions, VIP seats happen here.

This is where:
	•	Dating live sessions happen
	•	Business pitches happen
	•	Teaching happens

⸻

6. Chat & DM Screen

Two sections:
	•	Community Chats
	•	Private Messages

So you can:
	•	Chat in “Lagos Business Group”
	•	DM someone you met in football room
	•	Continue dating conversation

⸻

7. Profile Screen

Shows:
	•	Bio
	•	Interests
	•	Communities joined
	•	Verification badge
	•	Relationship intent (dating / business / learning)
	•	Live history

This helps users understand WHY to connect with someone.

⸻

5. Monetization – The Correct Way For Your Vision

Your monetization should be layered, not forced.

1. Live Gifting
	•	For hosts
	•	For speakers
	•	For dating interest
	•	For business appreciation

2. Community Subscriptions

Example:
	•	Premium Business Hub
	•	Exclusive Dating Lounge
	•	Private Learning Rooms

3. Profile Boosts
	•	Highlight in community
	•	Top of dating list
	•	Featured in live rooms

4. Event Tickets
	•	Paid classes
	•	Paid matchmaking events
	•	Business pitch events

This way:

People pay because value is clear, not because they are pressured
